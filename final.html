				<h3 style="color:tomato;">Trump's claims of election fraud continues to shape the political landscape </h3> 

			<p>After losing to Joe Biden during the 2020 Presidential election, former President Trump outright contested the results of the election. Throughout his campaign for re-election, Trump leaned into conspiracies claiming on voter fraud, ballot rigging, and uncounted votes. On November 7th, 2020, the morning Biden has been elected the 46th president of the United States, Trump clamied over Twitter: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

			<p>Even prior to the 2020 election, Trump has continuously resorted to discrediting political elections. From his skepticism of former President Barack Obama’s presidency in 2012 to demanding a reelection during the 2016 GOP primaries after losing to Ted Cruz, Trump is now no stranger to crying fraud. His claims of illegitimacy have been cited as encouragement in regards to the January 6th insurrection as well.</p>

			<p>Many of those in the Republican Party also adopted Trump’s views of election fraud and the disproven claim of illegitimacy in regards to the 2020 election. Although disproved, the claims incited by Trump, have continued to trickle down and affect the 2022 Midterm Elections as well. On the ballots of American voters, election deniers are among their midterm candidates.</p>

			<h1 style="color:Tomato;"> Election denialism existed among Republicans running across all 2022 Midterm positions </h1>

			<p>Within each political position, election deniers lay across all roles. While stances varied, data gathered by FiveThirtyEight showed that there was not any one category, those being the positions of Secretary of State, Governor, representative, senator, and attorney general, in which Republican election deniers were not running.</p>
						<div id="list">
				<h4 style="color:Tomato;">A list of all stances recorded and collected by FiveThirtyEight:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Fully accepted</li>
					<li>Accepted with reservations</li>
					<li>Raised questions</li>
					<li>Fully denied</li>
					<li>Avoided answering</li>
					<li>No comment</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>Among these, the office position that held the greatest number of election deniers are those candidates running as representatives. Of the representative candidates that ran during the 2022 midterm elections, 170 held the stance of “Fully Denied”. Only 48 held the stances of “Fully Accepting” with the rest having varying degrees of denial or refraining from giving a solid stance.</p>

<h3 style="color:Tomato;"> Many incumbent candidates also had stances supporting election denial</h3>

			<p id="with-element">Election denialism did not only exist among newly running or re-running candidates, but incumbent candidates as well. 138 political officials in office prior to the November 2022 Midterm elections held stances not accepting of the results. Of those, 119 fully denied, 10 raised questions, 6 gave no comment, and 3 avoided answering.</p>
			<p id="with-element">According to Governing, politicians who hold positions and denied the election, may use their stance as the basis to question other results, from smaller local state elections to reelection campaigns. These outcomes could include recalls and audits of votes, constrained voting requirements and rules, and voting laws. </p>
		</section>
		<section>

			<h3 style="color:Tomato;"> States with the most deniers</h3>

			<p> Election deniers also existed more prevalently across certain red leaning or swing states. Texas had the most deniers already incumbent and those newly running. Of the republican candidates, 22 from Texas held the stance of “Fully Denied” concerning the 2022 election. After Texas, Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee followed. </p>

			<p> Of Texas Republicans who deny the election, Governor Greg Abbot is outspoken on opposing President Biden’s presidency. Recently, Abbot demanded an investigation elections in Harris County. Published on Abbots page on Texas.Gov, he stated the allegations of election improprieties in our state's largest county may result from anything ranging from malfeasance to blatant criminal conduct. Voters in Harris County deserve to know what happened," expressing there was reason to be suspicious. This was despite no voter investigators finding anything of concern when the results were counted initially. </p>

			<p>According to critics, such as Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, Abbot’s demand is a targeted move to intimidate Harris county, which is democratic leaning, and his claims of Republican voter suppression are unfounded by voting officials and misusing potential basic errors to recall midterm results. Abbot is only one example of an election denier who has used unfounded questions on election validity to sway results in Republican’s favors. </p>

<h3 style="color:Tomato;"> Media outlets also have an influence on voter disbelief over the 2020 presidential elections</h3>
